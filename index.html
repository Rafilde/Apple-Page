            <h1>The history of the iOS logo</h1>

            <p><strong>The history of the iOS</strong> logo can be traced back to the introduction of the iPhone in 2007. The initial logo used for iOS, Apple's mobile operating system, was a simple silver Apple icon with a bite taken out of it, which has become synonymous with the company. This logo represented the sleek and minimalist design philosophy that Apple has been known for.</p>

            <h2>Your first version</h2>

            <p>Over time, as iOS evolved and new versions were released, the logo underwent several changes. <strong>With iOS 7 in 2013, Apple introduced a major redesign of the operating system</strong>, along with a new logo. The new logo featured a flat and colorful design, with a series of overlapping rounded rectangles in different shades of gray, blue, and green. This logo represented a departure from the skeuomorphic design of previous versions and embraced a more modern and vibrant aesthetic.</p>

            <p>The taks of creating a more modern and objective logo for Apple fell into the heands of graphic design Rob janoff, hired by Jobs in 1977. After meeting with Jobs for the first time earlier that year, Janoff spend about one week and half studying the shape of real apples and drawing several drafts of what would become his first and only prototype. 
            The first version of the good old Apple Bit was born, which the time still featured the classic rainbow alluding to the upcoming Apple II - the world's first personal computer with a <strong>color display</strong>.
